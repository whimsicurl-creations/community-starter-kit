### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: Help improve by using HTML and CSS to get this up and running.
- **qa-needed**: Check across multiple browsers, look for broken/missing links, and make sure everything works as expected.
- **documentation-needed**: Documentation isn't exciting, but it IS necessary.  Help us make sure everything is documented properly.
- **bug-high-priority**: We found a bug and we need it fixed FAST!  Help us squash this bug quickly.
- **bug-low-priority**: Another bug has been found, but make sure all high-priority bugs have been fixed first - this one can wait.
- **help-wanted**: A quick way to let everyone know you need some extra help in this area.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
